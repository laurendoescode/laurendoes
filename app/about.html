		<h1> Hi, hello, Wie geht’s?</h1>
			<span style="font-size:18px;">
			<p>I’m a self-taught Graphic Designer with a keen interest in Psychology. Over the last few years I've enjoyed working on a wide range of project from white papers for Microsoft to illustrating a new psychology test for MIT and Columbia University.</p>
			<p>
			Originally from the UK, I am currently living in Berlin. I've worked both nationally and internationally with clients across the UK, Europe, America and China.</p>
			<p>
			If you have any layout or illustration needs send me a quick email at hello@laurendo.es
