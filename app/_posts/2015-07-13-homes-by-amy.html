	<p><strong>The brief</strong>
	<br>Amy was launching her new realtor business and wanted to avoid the clichéd graphics and design styles used by her competitors. She wanted something friendly, personable and subtle. Amy requested we focus more on pastel and paler hues to complement her new design collateral.
As a part of the brand, we developed templates for sales signs, mailers, feature sheets for open days and promotional tags.
	</p>
	 
	<p><strong>The process</strong>
	<br>After chatting with Amy I realised that she wanted a design that was modern and sophisticated to reflect the high-end customers who trust her to both buy and sell their properties.
I created a project moodboard to centralise the themes and start exploring a few options with regard to graphical elements, colours etc.


	</p>
	<p><strong>It's all in the detail</strong>
	<br>The Jenna Sue typeface was used for ‘by Amy’ as it closely resembled Amy’s handwriting.  With the addition of a few custom tweaks, it gave the logo a personal ‘signed off’ appeal.
The slash was introduced as a brand element, used to annotate images and incorporate dual branding with Royal LaPage.
Direction was given on photography and framing of each shot to ensure that the aesthetic is as clean and clear as possible.
