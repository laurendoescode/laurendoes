    <p>
    To launch Honor’s new phone in Europe, Honor held a competition to design their new phone's icon interface and wallpapers. They wanted the design to be based around the theme #forthebrave.</p>
</div>
    <img class="one-up" src="/img/honor_icons.jpg" alt="Full icon set" />
    <img class="honorimg" src="/img/honor_mobile.png" alt="Icons on mobile interface" />
    <div class="doublethree-up">
        <p class="project-subheading">The process</p>
        <p>I interpreted brave as conquering new frontiers, both in new digital technology and geographical frontiers into Europe. Graphics are clean with a bold palette to inject vibrancy into the interface.
        For the set of wallpapers I concentrated on anabstract map of each European city. Illustrating London’s transport system for the submission.
