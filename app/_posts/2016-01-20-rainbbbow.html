                <p class="project-subheading">The idea</p>
                 <p>Dribbble is a a community led site where a wide array of creatives share small screenshots of their work. As so many different creatives use the site, it made us wonder, are there any global colour trends in the design industry. We created Rainbbbow. It is still in beta, so we are still tweaking the interface and it is still compiling the data from the daily upload shots. We are hoping to see seasonal as well as event variences across the Rainbbbow. It will be interesting to produce our end of year infographic to see what the overall results were.

            <p>Rainbbbow uses dribbble's api to depict the colour trends on dribbble. It presents the date in both daily and monthly colour changes, giving the option to view the colours split across the Rainbbbow or as just that day's majority colour.</p>
            <p>
                When experimenting with what display worked best, we included and excluded some colours. For example we've included pink and split the blues into light blue and dark blue. Without doing this red and blue dominated the visuals, making it difficult to see any variation between the other colours. We've also weighted the algorithum to visually show which colour was more common in shots.
