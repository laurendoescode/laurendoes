                <p class="project-subheading">The brief</p>
                <p>As the Microsoft branding is very wide-ranging, we chose to explore a few different typographic solutions incorporating the core brand assets and colours. Highlighting the fun, bold and colourful Microsoft brand in this way kept the white papers more light-hearted and made them stand out from more traditional corporate documents. Taking the copy for each whitepaper we created a flat plan for each to organise the spacing of the copy â€“ especially useful for the longer guides.

            <p class="project-subheading">The process</p>
            <p>We worked closely with the INhouse team to create an aesthetic that was fresh, but also fit into the constraints of their corporate documents. We worked on a range of white papers and their supporting templates for use in Word, PowerPoint and Excel. As well as conforming to Microsoft's brand guidelines, we were able to use the Microsoft image library to utilise and develop brand specific illustrations.</p>
            <p>The team behind the project wanted the white papers to look less corporate and more friendly, so we suggested the use of the strong brand palette and graphics throughout. We provided creative direction and when needed produced new illustrations for the covers of each whitepaper.
