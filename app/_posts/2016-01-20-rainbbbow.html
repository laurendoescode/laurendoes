                <p class="project-subheading">The idea</p>
                 <p>Rainbbbow is still in beta, so it still compiling the data from the daily upload shots, but we are hoping to see seasonal as well as event variences across the Rainbbbow. It will be interesting to produce our end of year infographic to see what the overall results were.

            <p class="project-subheading">The technical</p>
            <p>Rainbbbow uses dribbble's api to depict the colour trends on dribbble. It presents the date in both daily and monthly colour changes, giving the option to view the colours split across the rainbbbow or as just that day's majority colour.</p>
            <p>
                When experimenting with what display worked best, we included and excluded some colours. For example we've included pink and split the blues into light blue and dark blue. Without doing this red and blue dominated the visuals, making it difficult to see any variation between the other colours.
