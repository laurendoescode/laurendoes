                <p class="project-subheading">The idea</p>
                 <p>Dribbble is a community led site where a wide array of creatives share small screenshots of their work. As so many different creatives use the site, it made us wonder, are there any global colour trends in the design industry? </p>
                 <p>To anwser this question, we created Rainbbbow to document the colours used within each uploaded shot. We are hoping to see seasonal as well as event variences across the rainbow of colours. At the end of the year, we aim to produce infographics to visualise the overall results.
                 </p>
                 <p>Rainbbbow was a joint personal project with my partner in development Charles Bancroft - one of many joint projects we create under our joint studio name <a href="http://hellotrio.com/">Hello trio</a>.</p>
                 <p>The beta version of the project can be found at <a href="http://rainbbbow.com/">rainbbbow.com</a>

            <p>Rainbbbow uses dribbble's api to depict the colours used in dribbble shots. We created an algorithum to visually represent this data on Rainbbbow. Presenting the daily and monthly colour changes. We also split viewing options into two settings, giving the option to see the breakdown of colours used that day, or that day's most used colour.</p>
            <p>
                When experimenting with what displays worked best, we included and excluded some colours. For example we've included pink and split the blues into light blue and dark blue. Without doing this red and blue dominated the visuals, making it difficult to see any variation between the other colours. We've also weighted the algorithum to visually show which colour was more common in shots.
