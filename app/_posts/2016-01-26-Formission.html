            <p class="project-subheading">The brief</p>
            <p>Worked with Truly Apt, Nick Dunse as AD. Previously known as two entities: Springdale College and Together in Mission, this was a merger of two organisations that required a rebrand and rename - repositioning Springdale College and Together in Mission as a single entity.

Amalgamating both organisations was essential in creating a strong, unified brand identity that clearly and effectively encapsulated the core values and aims of the one organisation.
