	<h1>Formission brand collateral</h1>
	<p><em>Springdale College</em> and <em>Together in Mission</em> joined together to form a new faith college called Formission. I worked with the team at London based brand company Apt to design the collateral for the brand. Including email templates, adverts, yearly prospectus, guides and letter heads</a></p>

            <p class="project-subheading">The brief</p>
            <p>As two organisations were combining under the one name, a strong, unified brand identity was required. One that clearly and effectively encapsulated the core values and aims of the one organisation. Nick, the Marketing Director at Apt carried out extensive the market and brand research and directed how the brand should be positioned within the market space.
