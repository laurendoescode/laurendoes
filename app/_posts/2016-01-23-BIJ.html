    <p class="project-subheading">The brief</p>
    <p>The Bureau of Investigative Journalism held an industry event on Joint Enterprise to launch their newest report, <em>Joint Enterprise</em>. This report was to be launched in connection with the BBC drama <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1B1Uqh12xJI?rel=0" class="sliding-u-l-r-l"><em>Common</em></a>.
	They commissioned email event invitations, a 64 page report and an infographic. I worked with infographic designer Jack Hagley as Art Director.</p>

	<p>The full report can be found <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/03/31/read-the-report-joint-enterprise-an-investigation/" alt="Full layout design for The Bureau of Investigative Journalism by Lauren Kelly" class="sliding-u-l-r-l">here</a></p>

		<p class="project-subheading">The process</p>
		<p>Working with Jackâ€™s direction, we developed two different options for the collateral. Both were based around a triad to show that each accusant is connected equally in the eyes of the law under the new Joint Enterprise legislation. I developed two icon ideas, shown below with the client signing off on the one direction.</p>
		<p>Sections of the infographic to show key Joint Enterprise statistics. The full infographic can be found
