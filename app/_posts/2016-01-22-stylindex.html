        <p class="project-subheading">The brief</p>
        <p>Developing the idea of creating a black book for the fashion industry we developed an aesthetic that used a framing device, to be used over photography and over the square pattern. Holly needed a full brand package, from logo to typefaces, colour pallete and wider brand design. As well as focusing on the collateral around the brand, we produced style sheets for her UX designer to implement onto the app.
