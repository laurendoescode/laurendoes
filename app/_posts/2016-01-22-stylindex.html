				<h1>Whitepapers and supporting templates</h1>
				<p>Microsoft wanted a new range of whitepapers for the Cloud Surestep portal. They wanted something that was more playful than their usual documents and wanted to push the constraints of the more corporate brand guidelines. <br>All final collateral can be found <a href="https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/pages/solutions/cloud-surestep/build-your-business.aspx#building-your-business" alt="Design work by Lauren Kelly for Microsoft" class="sliding-u-l-r-l">here</a></p>

        <p class="project-subheading">The brief</p>
        <p>Worked with Truly Apt, Nick Dunse as AD. Previously known as two entities: Springdale College and Together in Mission, this was a merger of two organisations that required a rebrand and rename - repositioning Springdale College and Together in Mission as a single entity.
        <br>Amalgamating both organisations was essential in creating a strong, unified brand identity that clearly and effectively encapsulated the core values and aims of the one organisation.
