        <p class="project-subheading">The brief</p>
        <p>Driven by the tagline" Stylindex, be 'in' the know", we developed the idea we created an aesthetic that used a framing device. The frame literally showing the talent and professionals within the brand. This can be used over photography and over the square pattern where photography isn't available. <br><br>Having a pattern option was important to Holly, so that when she promotes the app to certain fashion sectors, the photography wont be at odds with their company's aesthetic. <br><br>Holly needed a full brand package, from logo to typefaces, colour pallete and wider brand design. As well as focusing on the collateral around the brand, we produced style sheets for her developer to implement the style onto the app.
