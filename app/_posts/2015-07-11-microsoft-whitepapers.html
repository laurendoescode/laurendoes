<h1>Microsoft: Whitepapers and supporting templates</h1>
<div class="collapse-trigger">Read more <img src="/img/LD-arrow.svg" width="20px" alt="Read more" /></div>

	<p><strong>The brief</strong>
	<br>I was brought on board by the INHouse team to design 20 whitepapers and Microsoft templates to be used by the Cloud SureStep customers. This spanned Word template assets, PowerPoint templates and Excel sheets.
	</p>
	<p>As well as conforming to Microsoft's brand guidelines, I was able to use the Microsoft image library to utilise and develop brand specific illustrations.
	The team behind the project wanted the white papers to look less corporate and more friendly, so I suggested the use of the strong brand palette and graphics throughout.
	I was the sole designer on this project and worked closely with the INHouse team to advise on the direction and design of each piece.
	</p>
	 
	<p><strong>The process</strong>
	<br>As the Microsoft branding is very wide-ranging, I chose to explore a few different typographic solutions incorporating the core brand assets and colours. Highlighting the fun, bold and colourful Microsoft brand in this way kept the white papers more light-hearted and made  them stand out from more traditional corporate documents.</p>
	<p>Taking the copy for each whitepaper I created a flat plan for each to organise the spacing of the copy â€“ especially useful for the longer guides.</p>
	 
	 
	<p><strong>It's all in the detail</strong>
	<br>I split long copy up into easy to digest chunks by dividing key sections with colourful sub-section title pages, custom illustrations and varied typography.</p>
