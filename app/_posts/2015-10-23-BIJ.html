<h2>The Bureau of Investigative Journalism</h2>

<p>The Bureau of Investigative Journalism held an industry event on Joint Enterprise to launch their newest report. This report was to be launched in connection with the BBC drama 'Common'.
They commissioned email event invitations, a 64 page report and an infographic. I worked with infographic designer <a href="http://www.jackhagley.com/">Jack Hagley</a> as Art Director.<p>

<p>The full report can be found <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/03/31/read-the-report-joint-enterprise-an-investigation/"> here</a><p>
