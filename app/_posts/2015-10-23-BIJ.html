<h2>The Bureau of Investigative Journalism</h2>

<p>The Bureau of Investigative Journalism held an industry event on Joint Enterprise to launch their newest report. This report was to be launched in connection with the BBC drama <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1B1Uqh12xJI?rel=0">'Common'</a>.
They commissioned email event invitations, a 64 page report and an infographic. I worked with infographic designer <a href="http://www.jackhagley.com/">Jack Hagley</a> as Art Director.<p>

<p>The full report can be found <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/03/31/read-the-report-joint-enterprise-an-investigation/"> here</a><p>
