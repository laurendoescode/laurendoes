	<p><strong>The brief</strong>
	<br>
	To launch Honor’s new phone in Europe, Honor held a competition to design their new phone's icon interface and wallpapers. They wanted the design to be based around the theme #forthebrave.</p>
	 
	<p><strong>The process</strong>
	<br>I interpreted brave as conquering new frontiers, both in new digital technology and geographical frontiers into Europe. Graphics are clean with a bold palette to inject vibrancy into the interface.
For the set of wallpapers I concentrated on anabstract map of each European city. Illustrating London’s transport system for the submission.
