	<h1>What is Gender Parity?</h1>
	<p>To mark this year's International Women's Day, we created an interactive infographic to tell the story of and highlight Gender Parity - this year's theme. We researched the issue, developed the narrative, illustrated the graphics and created the website. You can view the full site at <a href="http://womenofearth.co.uk/">wonenofearth.co.uk</a></p>

            <p class="project-subheading">The brief</p>
            <p>International Women’s day is a time to pause, get involved and take action on a number of important issues affecting women worldwide. To mark this year’s theme - Gender Parity - we decided to do our part in spreading the word and help ‘Pledge for Parity’. We created an interactive infographic to tell the story of and highlight Gender Parity. Using GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) and Scrollmagic you can scroll through Gender Parity’s definitions. Including campaigning for equality for gender balanced leadership, helping women achieve their ambitions, equal value and the biases that exist both consciously and unconsciously.

            <p class="project-subheading">Developing the idea</p>
            <p>
                We started by establishing the story we wanted the infographic to say. Developing research into Gender Parity, Pay inequality, Equal leadership in boardrooms to political leadership. Once we had an idea of the main facts we scamped out the flow of the infographic, starting with the negatives, the positives and the International Women's day call to action at the end. </p>
