                <p>I am what the industry would calls a 'Generalist'. Meaning I love bringing my wide range of experience to my projects. From branding to web design, app design, illustration or print design. I tend to work with smaller teams and startups, who hire me for my ability to adapt both my workflow and skill set to what ever problem they have. That said, I've also worked with larger clients including Microsoft, Contentful, British Biathalon and the British Government.</p>

                <p>It wouldn't be an about page without my story. So, in short, here goes. I've always been interested in creativity - my obsession with painting as a child comes to mind, but when it came to Uni I chose to study Psychology at the University of Sheffield. My logic, that people are so central to design that learning about what makes people tick and how things affect them would benefit me as a designer. I'm biased, but I think it worked out for the better.</p><p>
                Following a job in a London based publishing house, I took the leap and moved to Berlin and set myself up as a freelancer. I'm currently one half of Berlin based studio <a href="http://hellotrio.com/">Hello trio</a>, working with my partner on personal projects including <a href="http://rainbbbow.com/">Rainbbbow</a> (in beta) and <a href="http://womenofearth.co.uk/">Women of Earth</a>.</p>
                <p>
                A chance comment by a client, that ‘you always talk about psychology when you talk through your design choices’, led me to start my blog <a href="http://formforthought.com/">Form for Thought</a>. With articles covering psychology for designers, I wanted to share the insights I have learnt with others in the industry. It covers design-psy from pure theory to interviewing creatives about how they use psychology in their practice.</p>

                <p>I joke that I read more science journals now than I did doing my degree, but is has reinvigorated my drive towards psychology and design. I really enjoy UX design and am looking to take on more UX projects in the future.</p>

                <p>I attend workshops to hone my skills and am helping Laura and Zach organise HybridConf 2016, which this year is in Berlin.</p>
