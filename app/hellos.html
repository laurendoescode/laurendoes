                Hi, I’m Lauren.
                <p>I’ve been a Graphic Designer for the past 4 years, and am currently one half of Berlin based studio Hello trio. I’ve worked with wonderful teams both locally and internationally to produce design work for both print and digital. I’ve work on some really interesting projects, including illustrating a new IQ test for MIT and Columbia University, producing white papers for Microsoft and an infographic booklet for the British Government.</p>
                <p>I graduated from the University of Sheffield with a BSc in Psychology, gaining insights that I continue to use daily within my design practice. A chance comment by a client, that I ‘always talk about psychology when you talk through your design choices’, led me to start my blog Form for Thought. Docmenting psychology for designers, covering pure theory to interviewing creatives about how they use psychology in their practice.</p>
                <p>My shift towards the more psychological aspects of design has peaked my interest in UX design, a sector that combines my love of vigour from psychology and my passion for design. I’ve spent the last few months retraining and am now looking for a junior UX position in Manchester, UK to hone my skills further.</p>
                <p>If you know of an opening, please contact me at hi@laurenkelly.me</p>
                <p>I also continue to run Hello trio, so if you would like to hire me please contact say@hellotrio.com</p>

                <p>I am what the industry would calls a 'Generalist'. Meaning I love bringing my wide range of experience to my projects. From branding to web design, app design, illustration or print design. I tend to work with smaller teams and startups, who hire me for my ability to adapt both my workflow and skill set to what ever problem they have. That said, I've also worked with larger clients including Microsoft, British Biathalon and the British Government</p>
                <p>It wouldn't be an about page without my story. So, in short, here goes. I've always been interested in creativity - my obsession with painting as a child comes to mind, but when it came to Uni I chose to study Psychology at the University of Sheffield. My logic, that people are so central to design that learning about what makes people tick and how things affect them would benefit me as a designer. I'm biased, but I think it worked out for the better.
                Following a job in a London based publishing house, I took the leap and moved to Berlin and set myself up as a freelancer. I'm currently one half of Berlin based studio 'Hello trio', working with my partner on personal projects including rainbbbow and Women of Earth.

                A chance comment by a client, that ‘you always talk about psychology when you talk through your design choices’, led me to start my blog Form for Thought. Pitched as psychology for designers, I wanted to share the things I have learnt and what I read with others in the industry. It covering design-psy from pure theory to interviewing creatives about how they use psychology in their practice.

                I joke that I read more science journals now than I did doing my degree, bit is has reinvigorated my drive towards psychology and design.

                I attend workshops to hone my skills and am helping Laura and Zack organise Hybrid conference 2016, which this year is in Berlin.
