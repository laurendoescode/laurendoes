                    Hi, I’m Lauren.
                    <p>I’ve been a Graphic Designer for the past 4 years, and am currently one half of Berlin based studio Hello trio. I’ve worked with wonderful teams both locally and internationally to produce design work for both print and digital. I’ve work on some really interesting projects, including illustrating a new IQ test for MIT and Columbia University, producing white papers for Microsoft and an infographic booklet for the British Government.</p>
                    <p>I graduated from the University of Sheffield with a BSc in Psychology, gaining insights that I continue to use daily within my design practice. A chance comment by a client, that I ‘always talk about psychology when you talk through your design choices’, led me to start my blog Form for Thought. Docmenting psychology for designers, covering pure theory to interviewing creatives about how they use psychology in their practice.</p>
                    <p>My shift towards the more psychological aspects of design has peaked my interest in UX design, a sector that combines my love of vigour from psychology and my passion for design. I’ve spent the last few months retraining and am now looking for a junior UX position in Manchester, UK to hone my skills further.</p>
                    <p>If you know of an opening, please contact me at hi@laurenkelly.me</p>
                    <p>I also continue to run Hello trio, so if you would like to hire me please contact say@hellotrio.com</p>
